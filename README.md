## Why Speed Score and Memory Score?

The aim of us practicing DSA is to find the better approaches as to how we write code. Among the ways we measure this is by how fast the code runs and how much space it consumes.

Different sites measure and share with us how we performed. Whenever you submit you code, you will find it ranked, mostly in percentage of how you performed in comparison to others or how you performed in terms of test cases passed.

Just to make illustrate, here are two examples showing the scores we need to add.

For Leetcode, add both speedScore and memoryScore for example

> [90_60_Ginger-Stone.js] (_speedScore_: '90' and _memoryScore_: 60).
> ...**Always round up to avoid using decimals**.

### Leetcode Scores - _Annotated in red_

This file will now be named [91_78_Ginger-Stone.js] _speedScore_: '91' and _memoryScore_: 78.

### Codingame Scores - _Annotated in red_

This file will now be named [100_Ginger-Stone.js] Since score is defined as passing all test cases in Codingame, then we'll have our score as only the percentage.
